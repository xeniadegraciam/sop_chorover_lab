Part of the heat is going through the sample and part of it is surrounding it. Then the waves converge together and they are cancelling and constructing each other. That’s when the Fourier transform computation happens in the computer, bringing up the plot of **Absorbance VS. Wavelength**. Some molecules don’t respond to heat, nitrogen in the air doesn’t, so that’s why there is a nitrogen vacuum inside the machine, because it wont affect your sample measurement.\n\nSome peaks of interest for ATR in your sample:\n\n-   Hydroxides are on 3400 cm-1\n-   Aluminum hydroxides are on 3600 cm-1\n-   Silica is from 1030 to 1100 cm-1\n\n#### **OMNIC Computer Software**\n\n-   Window -\\> New Window \n\n(*This step is in case there was someone working previously and left their work plotted there.*)\n\n-   Check that the top of the window says **Experiment: iS50 ATR**\n\n**EXPERIMENT SETUP**\n\n-   Nothing has to be over the sample holder because you will measure the background first.\n-   Close the sampler until you hear **2 clicks**.\n-   Collect -\\> Number of scans: 64 -\\> **Collect Background after 120 minutes** -\\> Save\n\n![](SOP_files/figures/FTIR_ExpSetup.png)\n\n**COLLECT BACKGROUND**\n\n-   Start Collection (Up-right corner)\n-   A message will come after saying the data collection has stopped. *Add to a new window?

Also, this machine emits radiation so you have to be approved by RLSS to use it.\n-   When running samples during the **Monsoon season**, the Tension and Current to use in the software will be **20 kV and 10 mA**, respectively. For the rest of the year, it is 45 kV and 40 mA, respectively. This is because of the shortage of electricity during Monsoons.\n-   After finished, change back the current and tension to 20kV and 10 mA to protect the machine. **NEVER turn it off**.\n:::\n\n***NOTES:***\n\n-   The yellow light on the machine means it is shooting X-rays. The sample analyzer is delicate. Do not touch the doors because they are sensitive.\n\n-   The sample holder can take 15 samples per round of analyses.\n\n-   ***It takes around 1 hour and 45 minutes per sample to run a Quantitative scan.***\n\n### **Sample prep**\n\n![](SOP_files/figures/XRD_samples.png)\n\n-   Find the Corundum (alpha-Al2O3) in the desiccator. Heat the Corundum in the oven for at least 1 hour at 550 Celsius. Let it refresh for 1 hour. Store the Corundum on the desiccator when all the work has finished. -\\`If using toxic samples, prepare them in the fume hood.\n-   Using the Agate Mortar (or the ball mill), mix 1.5 gram of your sample, with 0.23 g of Corundum (*meaning 15% of your sample*). Take notes of the mass of sample, and Corundum used for each one. You need these data to fit your results afterwards.\n-   Clean the mortar and sample holder with Ethanol in between samples.\n-   Load your samples on the rings\n-   Overload a bit the ring and compress it. (*Each ring will consume approx. 1.5 grams of your sample*).\n-   Write your sample's ID with a Sharpy over the ring.\n\n### ***Start set up***\n\n**Log Notebook:**\n\n-   Check the tube counter and fill out the notebook log.\n-   Got to: System Maintainance -\\> Tube Counters -\\> TOTAL\n-   Take note on the before and after that number.\n-   Add your name on it, and the samples you intent to run. At the end of your analyses, you have to add the tube counter number, so everyone knows how many each person used.\n\n**Water refill:**\n\n-   Check the water level and the filler on the back of the lab. Fill them with super clean water, such as UV Reverse Osmosis water.

Bulk Density = Mass / Volume = 525 g / 250 mL = 2.1 g/mL\n-   Start filling the ring with sample until you get a height of 1 cm of material.\n-   Compact it very well, and scratch the surface a little in 2 directions, like a cross.\n-   Add another 1 cm layer of material, compact and scratch the surface.\n-   Repeat again until you full 525 g of material inside the ring.\n\n### **WP4-C**\n\n![WP4-C](SOP_files/figures/WP4C.png)\n\nThis is for the Dry part of the Soil-Water Characteristic Curve:\n\n#### **Bulk Density**\n\n-   Get the field bulk density of your sample and fill the cell called ***“B.D.”*** in the excel template that Mohammadreza prepared.\n-   If necessary, bulk density can be obtained by filling a cylinder with known volume, with the soil, and weight the soil. Bulk density = soil mass/ volume of cylinder.\n\n### **Moisture % for dry part of the SWCC**\n\n-   Weight each stainless-steel cup and insert that value on the cell ***“M_c”***. Put the name of each sample on the stainless-steel cup with a Sharpy.\n-   Bring your dry soil samples and take around 4 grams of each and put each on the stainless-steel cup. We need to preselect specific moisture content values for the dry part of the curve we are interested in studying. - This values can be based on the approximate known dry water content for each site. For example, if you know from previous studies an approximation of the dry water content, then the values should be around that. In this case we are selecting: 1% (0.01), 5% (0.05), 10% (0.10), 15% (0.15) and 20% (0.20). Insert these values on the cell called ***“th_v_1”***.\n-   The spreadsheet will indicate on the cell ***“M_w_1”*** how much water you should add to each sample to get the desired moisture content.\n-   Add the amount of water to each sample, cover with the lead, cover it with aluminum foil, put all your samples in a Ziploc bag to avoid loss of moisture by evaporation. Put them in the fridge for 3 days.\n\n### **WP4C calibration**\n\n-   Turn on the WP4C at least 15minutes before start using it.\n-   Take your samples from the fridge and put them on the Temperature Equilibration Plate at 23 Celsius.\n-   Using the ***Southeast button***, verify that the temperature difference is always negative (Ts – Tb).. Then press the same button to go back to the main menu.\n-   Poor the standard solution KCl in one of the cylinders and insert it to the sample holder. (The lead doesn’t fit the WP4C, so insert just the cylinder with no lead).\n-   Press the ***Southwest button*** to go to the calibration menu. Then press the ***Northeast button*** to start the calibration. - Rotate the button until it is on the READ option.\n-   It will take around 15 minutes, until it makes a peep sound, and flashes 3 times a green light.\n-   The pressure result for the calibration should be -2.22 MPa. If it is not that, you can arrange the value (+ -) in the screen of the machine.\n\n### **WP4C readings**\n\n-   Take out the KCl standard and insert your sample in the sampler holder. Read it. It will take around 15 minutes.\n-   Take note of the tension in Mpa. Fill that value in the template in the cell ***“h”***.\n-   Immediately read the weight of the sample in the balance. Fill it out in the cell called ***“M_c_ws”***.\n-   Change to a new sample to read it.\n-   After reading all the samples, put them in the oven with no lead for 24 hours at 105 Celsius.\n-   Read the dry weight of each sample after the 24 hours.

It also makes the quality of image better.\n- The SEM chamber can hold 6 samples, so divide your total number of samples by 6 to calculate how many rounds you need to do.\n:::\n\n\n**STARTING PROCESS**\n\n- Load your samples to the sample holder (these procedure could take 30 minutes for 6 samples)\n- Remember the position of your samples.\n- Log in to use the computer by scanning the QR code\n- Open the N2 valve (parallel to hose = open)\n- **Vent** -> Yes (because I already opened the N2 valve)\n- Wait until the pressure increase to 10^1, then it is safe to open.\n- Load the samples to the chamber.\n- Remember the position of your samples.\n- Measure the height of the samples, it must NOT exceed the height measured with the metallic tool.\n- Close the chamber and press it well.\n- **Pump**\n- Wait until the pressure decrease to 10^-4, and the drawing in the computer turns green (meaning its vacuumed)\n\n**Computer**\n\n- Setup:\n    - Spot: 3.0\n    - Voltage: 30 kV\n    - Map cross should be in the middle to get on top of the Gold standard\n    - Never cross the small circle with cross, just the big one.\n\n- **Beam On**\n- On \"Alignment\" section, find:\n    - Source Control -> Start -> Crossover (Uncheck the Limit voltage) -> **Increase until 1.9** (never go above 2)\n    ![Oval shape to get](SOP_files/figures/SEM_1.jpg)\n   \n    - Wait until the phrase \"Limit Voltage\" comes visible to click again.\n    - If the filaments don't work (meaning you cant see anything), then modify contrast and brightness.\n    - if it is super bright, we decrease the brightness.\n- **Check** \"Limit Voltage\"\n- Press **Finish**\n- Go back to main screen\n- Click on **Auto Contrast**\n- Zoom in by clicking on  **+**  button, on the light-grey area of Gold.\n- Go to focus (press **\"Reduced Area\"** and right-click at the same time)\n- You should see like **hexagon shape for the Gold** nano particles.\n- When having the \"Reduced Area\" activated, you can use **\"stigmation\"** by using shift and right-click at the same time, slide up-to-down, or left-to-right.\n- After you found the gold hexagons, **Zoom out** all the way to find your sample (~2mm scale).\n- Double click to move to your first sample.\n\n**First sample**\n\n- Zoom in with **+** and focus it using the **\"Reduced Area\"** focus.\n- Start measuring by going to the **graph section**.\n- Camera (to take the picture)\n- Press **F3** to activate contrast and brightness graphs, and change them by sliding the bar. (This can JUST be done when having the Camera photo activated)\n- Deactivate the graph mode by clicking F3 again.\n- Save As -> **.tiff file**\n\n***Take picture with no measurements first, then add your measurements and take the picture again***\n\n- Rule -> Draw your measurements\n- Save Again with your measurements\n- Click on **Pause** button to deactivate the Camera mode.\n- Zoom out (~2mm scale) to find your next sample.\n\n**Next Sample**\n\n- Center the sample by having the cross in the center of the entire sample, using double-click.\n- Zoom in\n- Find a spot with multiple edges\n- Go to \"Reduced Area\" Focus again:\n    - Right click and move left or right to manage contrast.\n    - Left click outside the square to finish when you find crispy (high resolution).\n- Save As\n- When done, delete all the measurement notes you did\n\n**CLOSING PROCESS**\n\n- Zoom out (~2mm scale)\n- Go back to the Gold center.\n- Alignments -> Start -> **Uncheck** the \"Limit voltage\"\n- Decrease the filament **\"Limit Voltage\" to 0.55**\n- When at 0.55, check again the \"Limit Voltage\"\n- Click in **\"Finish\"**\n- Beam Control -> **Beam Off** (the drawing of column upper from that button should get empty)\n- Wait 10 minutes\n- **Vent** (Wait to hear the \"Dark Vader\" opening sound)\n- Open door\n- Take samples out\n- **Pump** again (we always want to leave it on vacuumed)\n- Wait until the **pressure decrease to 10^-4**, and the drawing in the computer turns green (meaning its vacuumed)\n- Close the **N2 gas valve**\n- Sign out from the app by clicking **\"FINISH\"**\n- Clean samples out of the sample holder\n\n::: callout-note\n- Never close the software on the computer when you are done.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## **RS Key for weight printing on the balance**\n\n-   Download the RS Key program: [Download here!](https://weighing.andonline.com/winct/)\n-   Set up your interface in the same way as in this image:\n\n![RS Key set up](SOP_files/figures/rskey-1.png)\n\n-   Check on your computer devices (Bluetooth and devices -\\> Devices), for the port com number, and use that number for the RS Key program.\n\n![Com port on devices information](SOP_files/figures/com-port.png)\n\n[Back to top](#top)\n\n## **Freeze-Dryer**\n\nWhat this machine does is that it drys the sample through **Sublimation**, which is when solid water goes to vapor.\n\n-   **Bring your samples frozen.**\n-   Put kimwipes as cap of the container of your sample, tied with multiple rubber bands, so the vacuum can be applied and it can dry the sample, but still you particles don't run into the vacuum.\n-   Put the black rubber cap on.\n-   Grey cap connects to the black piece.\n-   If the tilted side of the grey cap is on the opposite direction that the transparent tube connection spot, then it is not connected to the vacuum so you can go ahead and insert the samples.\n-   Insert your samples carefully because the glass container can break if you throw them.\n- Add a paper filter to the tube connected to the central chamber, as a way to protect the central chamber from the particles of your samples.\n-   Now you can connect your samples to vacuum, by rotating the grey cap by 180 degrees, until the tilted side of the grey cap is aligned with the transparent tube that goes to your samples, allowing them to connect to the system.\n\n![Jars ready for Freeze-Dryer](SOP_files/figures/Freeze-Dryer.png)\n\n-   The black hose goes on the base of the machine needs to go on the trash can in case there is any oil spilling.\n-   Press **AUTO**. The vacuum has to end below 300. The temperature should be -40.\n-   **Leave the sample for 48 hours**\n-   *If the sample is still cold, there is still water on it, if it is room temperature, it is dry.*\n\n::: callout-important\n\n- Change the oil once a month.

Part of the heat is going through the sample and part of it is surrounding it. Then the waves converge together and they are cancelling and constructing each other. That’s when the Fourier transform computation happens in the computer, bringing up the plot of **Absorbance VS. Wavelength**. Some molecules don’t respond to heat, nitrogen in the air doesn’t, so that’s why there is a nitrogen vacuum inside the machine, because it wont affect your sample measurement.\n\nSome peaks of interest for ATR in your sample:\n\n-   Hydroxides are on 3400 cm-1\n-   Aluminum hydroxides are on 3600 cm-1\n-   Silica is from 1030 to 1100 cm-1\n\n#### **OMNIC Computer Software**\n\n-   Window -\\> New Window \n\n(*This step is in case there was someone working previously and left their work plotted there.*)\n\n-   Check that the top of the window says **Experiment: iS50 ATR**\n\n**EXPERIMENT SETUP**\n\n-   Nothing has to be over the sample holder because you will measure the background first.\n-   Close the sampler until you hear **2 clicks**.\n-   Collect -\\> Number of scans: 64 -\\> **Collect Background after 120 minutes** -\\> Save\n\n![](SOP_files/figures/FTIR_ExpSetup.png)\n\n**COLLECT BACKGROUND**\n\n-   Start Collection (Up-right corner)\n-   A message will come after saying the data collection has stopped. *Add to a new window?

Also, this machine emits radiation so you have to be approved by RLSS to use it.\n-   When running samples during the **Monsoon season**, the Tension and Current to use in the software will be **20 kV and 10 mA**, respectively. For the rest of the year, it is 45 kV and 40 mA, respectively. This is because of the shortage of electricity during Monsoons.\n-   After finished, change back the current and tension to 20kV and 10 mA to protect the machine. **NEVER turn it off**.\n:::\n\n***NOTES:***\n\n-   The yellow light on the machine means it is shooting X-rays. The sample analyzer is delicate. Do not touch the doors because they are sensitive.\n\n-   The sample holder can take 15 samples per round of analyses.\n\n-   ***It takes around 1 hour and 45 minutes per sample to run a Quantitative scan.***\n\n### **Sample prep**\n\n![](SOP_files/figures/XRD_samples.png)\n\n-   Find the Corundum (alpha-Al2O3) in the desiccator. Heat the Corundum in the oven for at least 1 hour at 550 Celsius. Let it refresh for 1 hour. Store the Corundum on the desiccator when all the work has finished. -\\`If using toxic samples, prepare them in the fume hood.\n-   Using the Agate Mortar (or the ball mill), mix 1.5 gram of your sample, with 0.23 g of Corundum (*meaning 15% of your sample*). Take notes of the mass of sample, and Corundum used for each one. You need these data to fit your results afterwards.\n-   Clean the mortar and sample holder with Ethanol in between samples.\n-   Load your samples on the rings\n-   Overload a bit the ring and compress it. (*Each ring will consume approx. 1.5 grams of your sample*).\n-   Write your sample's ID with a Sharpy over the ring.\n\n### ***Start set up***\n\n**Log Notebook:**\n\n-   Check the tube counter and fill out the notebook log.\n-   Got to: System Maintainance -\\> Tube Counters -\\> TOTAL\n-   Take note on the before and after that number.\n-   Add your name on it, and the samples you intent to run. At the end of your analyses, you have to add the tube counter number, so everyone knows how many each person used.\n\n**Water refill:**\n\n-   Check the water level and the filler on the back of the lab. Fill them with super clean water, such as UV Reverse Osmosis water. Craig buys gallons of that treated water, ask him to repay the amount of water you used with your project's budget.\n\n![](SOP_files/figures/XRD_water.png)\n\n**Computer:**\n\n-   *Username: XRDAdmin*\n-   *Password: braggX431*\n\n**X’Pert Data Collector Software:**\n\n-   *Username: Craig*\n-   *Password: tippy*\n-   Connect to the instrument, and click ok for the message that comes in.\n-   Click on “Instruments Settings” -\\> X-Ray -\\> Tension: 45 kV -\\> Current: 40 mA -\\> Apply (*you'll see the tension numbers changing on the machine*)\n\n**Creating an analysis program for your samples**\n\n-   File -\\> New Program -\\> Sample Changer Batch -\\> OK -\\> Insert -\\> Parkash 5.70 -\\> Change The Folder -\\> New Folder -\\> Rob Root (*if you are part of Chorover lab, put all your data inside Rob Root's folder, with your name*) -\\> Change the file name and put your sample's ID -\\> Fill out the Positions (*#1, #2...*).

Bulk Density = Mass / Volume = 525 g / 250 mL = 2.1 g/mL\n-   Start filling the ring with sample until you get a height of 1 cm of material.\n-   Compact it very well, and scratch the surface a little in 2 directions, like a cross.\n-   Add another 1 cm layer of material, compact and scratch the surface.\n-   Repeat again until you full 525 g of material inside the ring.\n\n### **WP4-C**\n\n![WP4-C](SOP_files/figures/WP4C.png)\n\nThis is for the Dry part of the Soil-Water Characteristic Curve:\n\n#### **Bulk Density**\n\n-   Get the field bulk density of your sample and fill the cell called ***“B.D.”*** in the excel template that Mohammadreza prepared.\n-   If necessary, bulk density can be obtained by filling a cylinder with known volume, with the soil, and weight the soil. Bulk density = soil mass/ volume of cylinder.\n\n### **Moisture % for dry part of the SWCC**\n\n-   Weight each stainless-steel cup and insert that value on the cell ***“M_c”***. Put the name of each sample on the stainless-steel cup with a Sharpy.\n-   Bring your dry soil samples and take around 4 grams of each and put each on the stainless-steel cup. We need to preselect specific moisture content values for the dry part of the curve we are interested in studying. - This values can be based on the approximate known dry water content for each site. For example, if you know from previous studies an approximation of the dry water content, then the values should be around that. In this case we are selecting: 1% (0.01), 5% (0.05), 10% (0.10), 15% (0.15) and 20% (0.20). Insert these values on the cell called ***“th_v_1”***.\n-   The spreadsheet will indicate on the cell ***“M_w_1”*** how much water you should add to each sample to get the desired moisture content.\n-   Add the amount of water to each sample, cover with the lead, cover it with aluminum foil, put all your samples in a Ziploc bag to avoid loss of moisture by evaporation. Put them in the fridge for 3 days.\n\n### **WP4C calibration**\n\n-   Turn on the WP4C at least 15minutes before start using it.\n-   Take your samples from the fridge and put them on the Temperature Equilibration Plate at 23 Celsius.\n-   Using the ***Southeast button***, verify that the temperature difference is always negative (Ts – Tb).. Then press the same button to go back to the main menu.\n-   Poor the standard solution KCl in one of the cylinders and insert it to the sample holder. (The lead doesn’t fit the WP4C, so insert just the cylinder with no lead).\n-   Press the ***Southwest button*** to go to the calibration menu. Then press the ***Northeast button*** to start the calibration. - Rotate the button until it is on the READ option.\n-   It will take around 15 minutes, until it makes a peep sound, and flashes 3 times a green light.\n-   The pressure result for the calibration should be -2.22 MPa. If it is not that, you can arrange the value (+ -) in the screen of the machine.\n\n### **WP4C readings**\n\n-   Take out the KCl standard and insert your sample in the sampler holder. Read it. It will take around 15 minutes.\n-   Take note of the tension in Mpa. Fill that value in the template in the cell ***“h”***.\n-   Immediately read the weight of the sample in the balance. Fill it out in the cell called ***“M_c_ws”***.\n-   Change to a new sample to read it.\n-   After reading all the samples, put them in the oven with no lead for 24 hours at 105 Celsius.\n-   Read the dry weight of each sample after the 24 hours. Insert that value o the cell called ***“M_c_ds”***.\n-   Insert all this information into the Excel template made by Mohammadreza to get the water content equivalent to each matric potential\n\n[Back to top](#top)\n:::\n\n# **LAB TOOLS & EXPERIMENTS**\n\nThe thesis of previous Chorover students help a lot with figuring out the steps to take for your experiments.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n## **SEM**\n\nYou can ask Rob to contact the **Research Support Services** to do this.\n\n-   Brooke Beam Massani, Ph.D.\n-   Staff Scientist\n-   bbeam@arizona.edu\n\nAll services should be acknowledged in publications and presentation as said in here:  <https://cbc.arizona.edu/rss/acknowledging-rss-units>\n\n![TB-B-Stage 6 of Andersen](SOP_files/figures/SEM_2_TB-B-St.6_with measur_Dec18.png)\n\n**PROCEDURE**\n\n**Bring:**\n\n- Labcoat\n- Masks\n- Ziplock for waste\n\n::: callout-important\n- **Always plan for: 40 minutes extra.
