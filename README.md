# **SOP - Chorover's lab**

#### Standard Operating Procedures I used while in Chorover's Lab.

#### The complete lab procedures are stored on this other address: [SOP](https://xenidegracia.github.io/sop_chorover_lab/SOP.html)

#### This is an ongoing work, this repository has all the procedures and links I needed while working on Chorover's Lab at the University of Arizona. Some of them may not be complete, but they are a start.

#### (*Also, this is a gift for Rob, to give him some rest from repeating the same information every time someone joins the lab xD* )
