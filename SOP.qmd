***For samples analyzed at SSRL:***

**SAMS VIEW**

-   **Add many files**. All must be scan replicates of the same sample (*files must be .xdi or .dat*)
-   **Detector**: Germanium (*most commonly*).
-   Press Apply All.
-   **Channel**
    -   1 for Arsenic. Or,
    -   2 for Iron (*check notebook*)
-   **Calibration**. To shift my value of gold to wherever the peak of gold is on my **muT2** Plot Type.
    -   Derivative must be First. Second one is too noisy.
    -   Replot
    -   Select the scan you want to calibrate.
    -   Press **Find Data E0**. This finds the peak for you. It must be around 11919 for gold.
        -   Apparent: the one it finds
        -   Actual: 11919 (gold)
        -   Press **Enter**
    -   Press **Apply Shift to Data**. It will apply the shift that it found.

![](SOP_files/figures/beamline_reference.png)

-   **Clean the channels** with weird data:
    -   Plot type: Column
    -   Derivative: None
    -   Column section:
        -   IFall (*to see all the channels plot at once*)
        -   IFind (*to check channel by channel individually*)
    -   Zero Selected Channel: for channels that are not working correctly
-   Plot Type: muF
-   Derivative: None
-   Stack All Plots
-   Save
    -   Group Spectra

### **ATHENA SOFTWARE**

#### **DATA NORMALIZATION**

-   File
-   Import Files: your average .xdi file
    -   Numerator: u
    -   Denominator: nothing
    -   OK
-   Emax: 1100
-   E0: Depending on the element you are looking for, see below:
    -   11885 for Arsenic
    -   7125 for Fe
    -   6565 for Mn
    -   13100 for Pb
-   Deglitch and Truncate
    -   Locate this option on the Drop Menu under Main Window
    -   Truncate Data if you need to drop the last 3 data points (e.g. fluorescence from 11-2)
    -   Select the point you want to truncate at the end of the data. (Erase the last 3 points).
-   Main Window
-   Shade the first sample
-   On the Normalization Section:
    -   Pre-edge range: from -150, to: -70.
    -   Normalization range: from 150, to: target the end of your curve
    -   With this, you are Normalizing the data, so the Edge step is \[post-edge line - pre-edge line\], this may have gotten a value of around 0.something.
    -   Choose the type of Normalization that will make the pre-edge and post-edge line to be almost parallel for your sample.
        -   Normalization order
            -   1 = no slope, (this one is UNcommon)
            -   2 = linear slope,
            -   3 = quadratic function
-   Forward Fourier transform parameters
    -   K-range should be the same in ALL the samples
-   Mark all your samples.
-   Group
    -   Set marked group values to current.
-   Finally, mark all your samples.
-   File
    -   Save EACH marked current group as:
        -   Normalized E

#### **LINEAR COMBINATION FITTING (automatic)**

*NOTE: For this process you must have all the scanned standards possibly existing on your system, to get how much percentage of each species is present on your sample.*

-   **Load** your standards and sample files.

-   Shade your sample, do not mark it.

-   Mark your standards.

-   On the drop menu, look for the option: **Linear Combination Fitting**

-   Press **Use Marked Groups**.

-   On the **Combinatorics** section: select the number of standards you are using on the combination.

    -   Use at most \_\_\_\_ standards (the amount of standards you are using).

-   Beside the enlisted Standards, there is a **“Required”** checkbox, check it for your initial and ending species.

-   Press **“Fit all combinations”**

-   Results will be shown on the “Combinatorics” tab.

    -   The first combination on this list is your best fit, the one with the lower R-factor.
    -   The weight for each component is the percentage of the composition of your sample.

-   **Save combinatorial results as an Excel file**

-   Unselect your standards and select JUST the samples.

-   Now under the **Standard tab**, we have the correct weight parameters from the Combinatorial.

-   Press **“Fit Marked Groups”**, for all the scans to be fitted to this parameter.

-   Under the **Sequence tab**, we have all the scans with the composition of each (see column titles of the table), and the concentration of each.

-   Save that table by pressing **“Save fit sequence report as an Excel file”**

-   We can plot that data with **“Plot components from fit sequence”**.

## **Craig's Rasmussen Lab Computer procedure for powder X-ray Diffraction**

This procedure applies if you analyze your samples at Craig Rasmussen's lab.

*Request permission from him before using their facilities. Also, this machine emits radiation so is always good to communicate when you are using it.*

***NOTES:***

-   The yellow light on the machine means it is shooting X-rays. The sample analyzer is delicate. Do not touch the doors because they are sensitive.

-   When running samples during the Monsoon season, the Tension and Current to use in the software will be 20 kV and 10 mA, respectively. For the rest of the year, it is 45 kV and 40 mA, respectively. This is because of the shortage of electricity during Monsoons.

-   The sample holder can take 15 samples per round of analyses.

-   ***It takes around 1 hour and 45 minutes per sample to run a Quantitative scan.***

### **Sample prep**

-   Find the Corundum (alpha-Al2O3) in the desiccator. Heat the Corundum in the oven for at least 1 hour at 550 Celsius. Let it refresh for 1 hour. Store the Corundum on the desiccator when all the work has finished. -\`If using toxic samples, prepare them in the fume hood.
-   Using the Agate Mortar (or the ball mill), mix 1.5 gram of your sample, with 0.23 g of Corundum (*meaning 15% of your sample*). Take notes of the mass of sample, and Corundum used for each one. You need these data to fit your results afterwards.
-   Clean the mortar and sample holder with Ethanol in between samples.
-   Load your samples on the rings
-   Overload a bit the ring and compress it. (*Each ring will consume approx. 1.5 grams of your sample*).
-   Write your sample's ID with a Sharpy over the ring.

### ***Start set up***

**Log Notebook:**

-   Check the tube counter and fill out the notebook log.
-   Got to: System Maintainance -\> Tube Counters -\> TOTAL
-   Take note on the before and after that number.
-   Add your name on it, and the samples you intent to run. At the end of your analyses, you have to add the tube counter number, so everyone knows how many each person used.

**Water refill:**

-   Check the water level and the filler on the back of the lab. Fill them with super clean water, such as UV Reverse Osmosis water. Craig buys gallons of that treated water, ask him to repay the amount of water you used with your project's budget.

**Computer:**

-   *Username: XRDAdmin*
-   *Password: braggX431*

**X’Pert Data Collector Software:**

-   *Username: Craig*
-   *Password: tippy*
-   Connect to the instrument, and click ok for the message that comes in.
-   Click on “Instruments Settings” -\> X-Ray -\> Tension: 45 kV -\> Current: 40 mA -\> Apply (*you'll see the tension numbers changing on the machine*)

**Creating an analysis program for your samples**

-   File -\> New Program -\> Sample Changer Batch -\> OK -\> Insert -\> Parkash 5.70 -\> Change The Folder -\> New Folder -\> Rob Root (*if you are part of Chorover lab, put all your data inside Rob Root's folder, with your name*) -\> Change the file name and put your sample's ID -\> Fill out the Positions (*#1, #2...*). Do it 15 times because that is the maximum of samples the sample holder can get per time.
-   Hit the Disk button -\> Save Program As -\> Use "*Craig*" as the user.

*After loading your samples to the machine*

-   Measure -\> Program -\> Select the program you just created for your samples -\> OK
-   Bring a USB to extract your data.
-   The files will be on .XRDML format.
-   You can analyze that data with RockJok or X'pert. Check out the other sections of this repository to know how to analyze them.

***After finished, change back the current and tension to 20kV and 10 mA to protect the machine. NEVER turn it off.***

### **XRD Process Optimization**

-   **pH stability**
    -   Selection of minerals based on the pH of the sample, prior to doing the Full-Pattern Summation
-   **Adding more minerals to Rockjock**
    -   Adding Alunite and the other 20 to the Rockjock library
-   Found Alunite in XAS
    -   Discovered Alunite through XAS (Jarosite but with Al instead of Fe). showing the need to wider the Rockjock library with other minerals.
-   Xpert is a slow process
    -   Checking which site has Alunite in Xpert one by one is a long process
-   Full Pattern Summation with Rockjock library
    -   Instead, check the sites automatically through Full Pattern Summation with the Rockjock library
-   VESTA to get XRD
    -   CIFF files were used to get the XRD through VESTA Wavelength Copper 1.5406 2theta range: 5 – 65 Step size: 0.02

## **Sample prep for powder XRD with Corundum**

-   Heat the Corundum (Aluminum Oxide) in the oven for 3 hours at 550 Celsius. The fume hood from *Sam Rathke (srathke\@arizona.edu)* located at 503 lab works well for this.
-   Use 1.5 gram of your sample, with 0.23 g of Corundum (meaning 15% of your sample's weight).
-   Use the ball mill to shake your sample with Corundum for 3 minutes.
-   Clean the ball mill between samples with Ethanol.
-   Then shake the ball mill with just Sand for another 3 minutes.
-   Then proceed to shake your following sample.
-   If you are **not** analyzing your samples yourself, you can send them to the *Chemistry & Biochemistry Lab (Andrei Astachkine: andrei\@arizona.edu)*

## **Specific Surface Area**

*NOTES*:

- Liquid Nitrogen must be ordered beforehand, and it can be picked up from the Cryogenics Facilities **from 8 to 11 a.m. on weekdays**. (*See Administrative procedure for this, the link to order is there*)
- The sample degassing pre-treatment for mine tailings takes about 12 hours, previous to the actual measurement.
- The Black Carbon standard sample (BC) should be done daily first thing before analyzing any of your samples. . It should show an SSA of about 21 m2/g.


### **Sample preparation:**

-   Check that the Gas Nitrogen is available for degassing, and also Liquid Nitrogen for the measurement
-   Weight a clean, empty tube, and write down the weight on the lab notebook.
-   Fill it with a sample using the metallic funnel. *These tubes are very fragile, so be careful*.
-   Weight the tube+sample, and add that on the lab notebook.
-   Degas the samples overnight with a temperature of **45 Celsius** because I’m using tailings. (*If I increase the temperature I could convert my ferrihydrite to Goethite, and we don’t want that.*)

### **Computer procedure: Gemini program**

-   Measure the Black Carbon sample (BC) first thing daily. It should show an SSA of about **21 m2/g**.
-   Press: "**Start Analysis**"
-   Next
-   **New**
-   Method: **Specific Surface Area**
-   Sample: **insert name** (The way of saving a sample is: “YearMonthDay”*”sampleID”*”yourInitials”, example: 20230121_Keating_XD)
-   Operator: **insert your initials**
-   Calculate
-   Empty Weight
-   Sample+Tube Weight
-   Save As: **same as sample name** (.SMP file is the default, use that one)
-   Once your weights appear in the "Analysis" screen, you can press **Start**.

**NOTE: If you have an error in the computer, take a screenshot and save it in the PPT that is open in that computer.**

## **Soil-Water Characteristics**

### **HYPROP for Soil-Water Characteristic Curves**

***Work in progress...***

#### Sample prep

-   Pack the HYPROP cells with sample at a bulk density equal to 2.2 g/cm3
-   To get that bulk density, we need to fill 525 g of material inside the 250 mL metal ring. Bulk Density = Mass / Volume = 525 g / 250 mL = 2.1 g/mL
-   Start filling the ring with sample until you get a height of 1 cm of material.
-   Compact it very well, and scratch the surface a little in 2 directions, like a cross.
-   Add another 1 cm layer of material, compact and scratch the surface.
-   Repeat again until you full 525 g of material inside the ring.

### **WP4-C**

This is for the Dry part of the Soil-Water Characteristic Curve:

#### **Bulk Density**

-   Get the field bulk density of your sample and fill the cell called ***“B.D.”*** in the excel template that Mohammadreza prepared.
-   If necessary, bulk density can be obtained by filling a cylinder with known volume, with the soil, and weight the soil. Bulk density = soil mass/ volume of cylinder.

### **Moisture % for dry part of the SWCC**

-   Weight each stainless-steel cup and insert that value on the cell ***“M_c”***. Put the name of each sample on the stainless-steel cup with a Sharpy.
-   Bring your dry soil samples and take around 4 grams of each and put each on the stainless-steel cup. We need to preselect specific moisture content values for the dry part of the curve we are interested in studying. - This values can be based on the approximate known dry water content for each site. For example, if you know from previous studies an approximation of the dry water content, then the values should be around that. In this case we are selecting: 1% (0.01), 5% (0.05), 10% (0.10), 15% (0.15) and 20% (0.20). Insert these values on the cell called ***“th_v_1”***.
-   The spreadsheet will indicate on the cell ***“M_w_1”*** how much water you should add to each sample to get the desired moisture content.
-   Add the amount of water to each sample, cover with the lead, cover it with aluminum foil, put all your samples in a Ziploc bag to avoid loss of moisture by evaporation. Put them in the fridge for 3 days.

### **WP4C calibration**

-   Turn on the WP4C at least 15minutes before start using it.
-   Take your samples from the fridge and put them on the Temperature Equilibration Plate at 23 Celsius.
-   Using the ***Southeast button***, verify that the temperature difference is always negative (Ts – Tb).. Then press the same button to go back to the main menu.
-   Poor the standard solution KCl in one of the cylinders and insert it to the sample holder. (The lead doesn’t fit the WP4C, so insert just the cylinder with no lead).
-   Press the ***Southwest button*** to go to the calibration menu. Then press the ***Northeast button*** to start the calibration. - Rotate the button until it is on the READ option.
-   It will take around 15 minutes, until it makes a peep sound, and flashes 3 times a green light.
-   The pressure result for the calibration should be -2.22 MPa. If it is not that, you can arrange the value (+ -) in the screen of the machine.

### **WP4C readings**

-   Take out the KCl standard and insert your sample in the sampler holder. Read it. It will take around 15 minutes.
-   Take note of the tension in Mpa. Fill that value in the template in the cell ***“h”***.
-   Immediately read the weight of the sample in the balance. Fill it out in the cell called ***“M_c_ws”***.
-   Change to a new sample to read it.
-   After reading all the samples, put them in the oven with no lead for 24 hours at 105 Celsius.
-   Read the dry weight of each sample after the 24 hours. Insert that value o the cell called ***“M_c_ds”***.
-   Insert all this information into the Excel template made by Mohammadreza to get the water content equivalent to each matric potential

# **EXPERIMENT / TOOLS**

The thesis of previous Chorover students help a lot with figuring out the steps to take for your experiments.

::: panel-tabset

## **RS Key for weight printing on the balance**

-   Download the RS Key program: [Download here!](https://weighing.andonline.com/winct/)
-   Set up your interface in the same way as in this image:

![RS Key set up](SOP_files/figures/rskey-1.png)

-   Check on your computer devices (Bluetooth and devices -\> Devices), for the port com number, and use that number for the RS Key program.

![Com port on devices information](SOP_files/figures/com-port.png)

## **Freeze-Dryer**

What this machine does is that it drys the sample through Sublimation, which is when solid water goes to vapor.

-   **Bring your samples frozen.**
-   Put kimwipes between your sample and the cap, so particles don't enter the vacuum.
-   Put the cap on.
-   The black hose goes on the trash can for spilling.
-   Press **AUTO**. The vacuum has to end below 300. The temperature should be -40.
-   Grey cap connects to the black piece.
-   If the tilted side is on the same direction that the tube, then it s open.
-   **Leave the sample for 48 hours**
-   *If the sample is still cold, there is still water on it, if it is room temperature, it is dry.*

## **Centrifuge**

Set up:

- Turn on the centrifuge (it cannot open until you turn it on)
- Check that the rotor and lead that you choose are same model.
- Weight the tubes with sample that you are using, as you will have to balance them out by putting them in opposite directions on the rotor.

![Balancing out the tubes on the rotor](SOP_files/figures/centrifuge_rotor_balance.gif)

- Lock the 2 leads on the rotor
  - Big lead = cover for the rotor
  - Small lead = core holding the entire rotor
  
Sowftware:

- On the buttons of the rotor:
  - Select rotor 
  - **Rotor**
  - (look for the name of the model of rotor you are using)
  - Set the Max RPM. You have 2 options:
    - **RCF** (this one is to report on the manuscripts, Jon likes this one, because it doesnt change by the rotor)
    - RPM (do not recommend using this one)
  - **START**
