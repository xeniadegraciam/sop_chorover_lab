# **MINERALOGY**

You can get the .CIFF files for minerals at the [RUFF database](https://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/AMS/amcsd.php).

Cite the database as: *Downs, R.T. and Hall-Wallace, M. (2003) The American Mineralogist Crystal Structure Database. American Mineralogist 88, 247-250.* [Link to paper](http://geo.arizona.edu/xtal/group/pdf/am88_247.pdf)

::: panel-tabset
## **Sample prep for powder XRD with Corundum**

-   Heat the Corundum (Aluminum Oxide) in the oven for 3 hours at 550 Celsius. The fume hood from *Sam Rathke (srathke\@arizona.edu)* located at 503 lab works well for this.
-   Use 5 grams of your sample and add 10% of that weight of Corundum (0.05 g).
-   Use the ball mill to shake your sample with Corundum for 3 minutes.
-   Clean the ball mill between samples with Ethanol.
-   Then shake the ball mill with just Sand for another 3 minutes.
-   Then proceed to shake your following sample.
-   If you are **not** analyzing your samples yourself, you can send them to the *Chemistry & Biochemistry Lab (Andrei Astachkine: andrei\@arizona.edu)*

## **Craig's Rasmussen Lab Computer procedure for X-ray Diffraction**

This procedure applies if you analyze your samples at Craig Rasmussen's lab.

Request permission from him before using their facilities.

### **X’Pert Data Collector program:**

-   Check the water level and the filler. Fill them with super clean water, such as UV Reverse Osmosis water.
-   *Username: Craig*
-   *Password: tippy*
-   Connect to the instrument, and click ok for the message that comes in.
-   Click on “Instruments Settings” -\> X-Ray -\> Tension: 45 kV -\> Current: 40 mA

*NOTES:*

-   The yellow light on the machine means it is shooting X-rays. The sample analyzer is delicate. Do not touch the doors because they are sensitive.

-   When running samples during the Monsoon season, the Tension and Current to use in the software will be 20 kV and 10 mA, respectively. For the rest of the year, it is 30 kV and 10 mA, respectively. This is because of the shortage of electricity during Monsoons.

**It takes around 1.5 hours per sample to run a Quantitative scan.**

## **Full Pattern Summation with powdR package (Rockjock library)**

This analysis uses Full Pattern Summation and the "powdR" package to analyze x-ray diffraction patterns.

### **XRD Process Optimization**

-   **pH stability**
    -   Selection of minerals based on the pH of the sample, prior to do the Full-Pattern Summation
-   **Adding more minerals to Rockjock**
    -   Adding Alunite and the other 20 to the Rockjock library
-   Found Alunite in XAS
    -   Discovered Alunite through XAS (Jarosite but with Al instead of Fe). showing the need to wider the Rockjock library with other minerals.
-   Xpert is a slow process
    -   Checking which site has Alunite in Xpert one by one is a long process
-   Full Pattern Summation with Rockjock library
    -   Instead: check the sites automatically through Full Pattern Summation with the Rockjock library
-   VESTA to get XRD
    -   CIFF files were used to get the XRD through VESTA Wavelength Copper 1.5406 2theta range: 5 – 65 Step size: 0.02

## **Rietveld Refinement with X'pert HighScore**

We use the X'pert HighScore program to analyze the data with Rietveld Refinement.

# **SPECTROSCOPY**

[SYNCHROTRON VISIT LOGBOOK](https://arizona.box.com/s/hsgb6jg237s6oge5pqmd8hn69ml6k7s6)

The link above contains the scanned version of the synchrotron visit logbook with all the notes taken during synchrotron visits, from page 1 to page 233 of the logbook (last synchrotron visit scanned: December 2024). This helps identify the labels used on the data files scanned and if there were specific observations to note during the synchrotron visit.

# **PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES**

::: panel-tabset

## **Specific Surface Area**

### **Sample preparation:**

-   Liquid Nitrogen must be ordered previously, and you can pick it up from the Cryogenics Facilities from 8 to 11 am every day.
-   Check that the Gas Nitrogen is available for degassing.
-   Weight a clean empty tube
-   Fill it with a sample
-   Weight the tube+sample
-   Degas the samples overnight with a temperature of 45 Celsius because I’m using tailings. If I increase the temperature I could convert my ferrihydrite to Goethite, and we don’t want that.

### **Computer procedure: Gemini program**

-   Calibrate the machine with the Black Carbon sample, which has an SSA of about 21 m2/g.
-   Next
-   New
-   Method: Specific Surface Area
-   Sample: **insert name** (The way of saving a sample is: “YearMonthDay”*”sampleID”*”yourInitials”, example: 20230121_Keating_XD)
-   Operator: **insert your initials**
-   Calculate
-   Empty Weight
-   Sample+Tube Weight
-   Save As: **same as sample name**
-   Once your weights appear in the "Analysis" screen, you can press Start.

**NOTE: If you have an error in the computer, take a screenshot and save it in the PPT that is open in that computer.**

## **Particle size distribution**

This is done with the Laser Diffraction from *Marcel Schaap's Lab*.

Request permission from him before using their facilities.

## **Soil-Water Characteristics**

### **HYPROP for Soil-Water Characteristic Curves**

### **WP4-C**

Dry part of the Soil-Water Characteristic Curve

#### **Bulk Density**

-   Get the field bulk density of your sample and fill the cell called ***“B.D.”*** in the excel template that Mohammadreza prepared.
-   If necessary, bulk density can be obtained by filling a cylinder with known volume, with the soil, and weight the soil. Bulk density = soil mass/ volume of cylinder.

### **Moisture % for dry part of the SWCC**

-   Weight each stainless-steel cup and insert that value on the cell ***“M_c”***. Put the name of each sample on the stainless-steel cup with a sharpy.
-   Bring your dry soil samples and take around 4 grams of each and put each on the stainless-steel cup. We need to preselect specific moisture content values for the dry part of the curve we are interested in studying. - This values can be based on the approximate known dry water content for each site. For example, if you know from previous studies an approximation of the dry water content, then the values should be around that. In this case we are selecting: 1% (0.01), 5% (0.05), 10% (0.10), 15% (0.15) and 20% (0.20). Insert these values on the cell called ***“th_v_1”***.
-   The spreadsheet will indicate on the cell ***“M_w_1”*** how much water you should add to each sample to get the desired moisture content.
-   Add the amount of water to each sample, cover with the lead, cover it with aluminum foil, put all your samples in a Ziploc bag to avoid loss of moisture by evaporation. Put them in the fridge for 3 days.

### **WP4C calibration**

-   Turn on the WP4C at least 15minutes before start using it.
-   Take your samples from the fridge and put them on the Temperature Equilibration Plate at 23 Celsius.
-   Using the ***Southeast button***, verify that the temperature difference is always negative (Ts – Tb).. Then press the same button to go back to the main menu.
-   Poor the standard solution KCl in one of the cylinders and insert it to the sample holder. (The lead doesn’t fit the WP4C, so insert just the cylinder with no lead).
-   Press the ***Southwest button*** to go to the calibration menu. Then press the ***Northeast button*** to start the calibration. - Rotate the button until it is on the READ option.
-   It will take around 15 minutes, until it makes a peep sound, and flashes 3 times a green light.
-   The pressure result for the calibration should be -2.22 MPa. If it is not that, you can arrange the value (+ -) in the screen of the machine.

### **WP4C readings**

-   Take out the KCl standard and insert your sample in the sampler holder. Read it. It will take around 15 minutes.
-   Take note of the tension in Mpa. Fill that value in the template in the cell ***“h”***.
-   Immediately read the weight of the sample in the balance. Fill it out in the cell called ***“M_c_ws”***.
-   Change to a new sample to read it.
-   After reading all the samples, put them in the oven with no lead for 24 hours at 105 Celsius.
-   Read the dry weight of each sample after the 24 hours. Insert that value o the cell called ***“M_c_ds”***.
-   Insert all this information into the Excel template made by Mohammadreza to get the water content equivalent to each matric potential
